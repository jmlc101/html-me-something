                             that specializes in hamburgers. The company, founded by Harmon Dobson and Paul Burton, opened its first restaurant in Corpus Christi, Texas,
                              in 1950. The chain is owned and operated by the Dobson family, along with 25 franchisers.[3]
                               As of April 2017, there are currently 809 Whataburger stores across the Southeastern and Southwestern United States regions.[2]
                             Whataburger was known for many years for its distinct A-framed orange-and-white-stripe-roofed buildings.
                              The first A-frame restaurant was built in Odessa, Texas, and is now a historical landmark.[4]
                            The company's core products includes the "Whataburger", the "Whataburger Jr.", the "Justaburger", the "Whatacatch" (fish sandwich),
                             and the "Whatachick'n". The company also has a breakfast menu.<br> -Wikipedia</td>

                        <td class='tdtext'>Wendy's is an American international fast food restaurant chain founded by Dave Thomas on November 15, 1969, in Columbus, Ohio.
                             The company moved its headquarters to Dublin, Ohio, on January 29, 2006. As of 2016, Wendy's was the world's third largest hamburger fast food
                              chain with 6,500+ locations, following Burger King and McDonald's. On April 24, 2008, the company announced a merger with Triarc Companies Inc.
                              , a publicly traded company and the parent company of Arby's. Despite the new ownership, Wendy's headquarters remained in Dublin. Previously,
                               Wendy's had rejected more than two buyout offers from Triarc. Following the merger, Triarc became known as Wendy's/Arby's Group, and later as
                                The Wendy's Company. As of January 2, 2017, there were a total of 6,537 locations, including 330 that are company-owned. 6,207 restaurants
                                 are franchised, and 77% of them are located in North America. While Wendy's sets standards for exterior store appearance, food quality, and
                                  menu, individual owners have control over hours of operations, interior decor, pricing and staff uniforms and wages.
                                Wendy's menu consists primarily of hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, French fries and beverages, including the signature Frosty, which is a
                                 soft-serve frozen dairy dessert. Since phasing out their famous "Big Classic", the company does not have a signature sandwich, such as the
                                  Burger King Whopper or the McDonald's Big Mac - although, by default, the "signature sandwich" spot seems to have been filled by Dave's
                                   1/4 lb. Single (introduced in 2011 as Dave's Hot 'N Juicy as a reworking of the longstanding Wendy's Single, shortened to simply Dave's in
                                    2016), a square-pattied burger made with fresh ground beef rather than round frozen patties. Wendy's uses square hamburger
                                     patties – which hang over the edge of a circular bun – as its signature item.<br> -Wikipedia</td>

                             As of September 5 2017, 3,557 restaurants were in 45 U.S. states. In 2011, it was ranked 10th in QSR Magazine's rankings of the top 50
                              quick-service and fast-casual restaurant brands in the nation (moving to 13th for 2015 and 2016).[2] Known for its use of carhops on roller
                               skates, the company annually hosts a competition to determine the top skating carhop in its system.
                            Sonic's menu consists of hamburgers and French fries, as well as onion rings, corn dogs, chili dogs and breakfast toaster sandwiches. Drink
                             options include soft drinks, slushes, and milkshakes. Customers can combine various drinks and flavors to create thousands of possible drink
                              combinations.[5][6] Ice cream desserts include sundaes and banana splits.
                            At a standard Sonic Drive-In, a customer drives into a covered drive-in stall, orders through an intercom speaker system, and has the food
                             delivered by a carhop. Most drive-ins also have patio seating, and many have drive-thru lanes.<br> -Wikipedia</td>
